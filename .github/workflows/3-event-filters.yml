# Selective Branch and Path Filtering Workflow
# This workflow demonstrates how to use event filters to optimize CI/CD performance
# by only running on specific branches and ignoring documentation changes

  push:
    # Only run on these branches
    branches:
      - dev                 # Development branch
      - 'release/*'         # Any release branch (release/v1.0, release/v2.1, etc.)
    
    # Ignore changes that only affect documentation
    paths-ignore:
      - 'docs/**'           # Ignore all files in docs/ directory and subdirectories
